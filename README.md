# Change Log Plugin

This plugin is used to create a Markdown file based on the git history of the project. This plugin in particular is parsing out commits that follow the conventional commit pattern. The pattern of how the change log is laid out is by a JSON.

**Currently Supported Types**
- feat
- fix
- change

## Setup

### Importing

Gradle link : https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/io.github.kmbisset89.changelog.plugin

The above link has the most up to date instructions on how incorporate this plugin with your project build gradle.

### Configuring

There are a few customization options for this plugin.

#### Version Regex

The way that the plugin groups the conventional commits is by a tag regex. Currently based off of semantic versioning, the default is matching [Int].[Int].[Int]. Examples of this pattern are 1.0.0, 0.1.5097, and 23.87.1989. If you use release candidates, and have not release code these will be grouped as unreleased changes. Example of which is the tag 1.0.1 exist but a feature is pushed creating 1.0.2-rc.1. This would be untracked until 1.0.2 tag had been finalized.

The above paragraph states what is default. You can however pass in a regex for the rules for the generator to follow.

#### Formatting JSON

The goal of utilizing this pattern was to create a way for other to implement the ChangeLog they wanted generated without too much headache. The list below shows the current keywords.

* ##### title

        This keyword allows for a custom document title.

* ##### introduction

        Any static text that should be included before the autogenerated portion.

* ##### eachVersion

        Nested JSON with how to handle the components of each version.

  * ###### tag

        Use this key to put the version into the CHANGELOG.

  * ###### feat - New features

         title - Section Title
         each - for each conventional commit

         each - for each conventional commit
